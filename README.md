# Awesome-O-Tron
This is a "Network Awesome" inspired app built on the MEAN stack.  It's currently built without any user/security in mind, just purely for anyone who wants to create a youtube playlist and then watch it without all the crazy advertising that you often go through on the actual youtube site.
